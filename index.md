# Hello, Stranger

I'm drd.
This is my personal blog.
In here you will find some info about me, about interesting stuff that i do, maybe some news that i deem important, but not much else.  I won't always post regularly, but my work ethics focus on the "quality over quantity" principle. So suit yourself.
I like music, and i post some mixes that i make for my personal pleasure. Check them out on my mixes page.
I'm an evil martian vimmer, so take a look at my emacs config file if you'd like (click on "emacs" in the navbar).
I also have a [github](https://github.com/Dr-Dd "github"). Feel free to fork any of my projects.
