So, what are the reasons behind this mix? As i already said before, just to pass the time. In fact, the central theme that i wanted to explore was the mind numbing thoughts that our brains come up with when we don't have anything to do on our hands.
A situation in which i usually found myself in the last month or so, due to the frequent trips that i have to take from my office or my university to my house.
Long trips, during which i try to find something to do, to not let my mind wander too much.
There are lots of things an individual can do to pass the time. Since my commuting is usually done via public transportation, the activities from which i can choose from are not many.
Since i don't like to read in public places, or at least not very crowded ones, i usually prefer to put some earphones on and zone out while listening to my Youtube playlists. And between every song, i try to see if there are any other songs in the same key as the one i'm currently listening to, or maybe with similar themes, or just with the same vibe. And when two tracks really sound good togheter, i write them down, rearrange them, and so on, until by pure chance i create a new mix.
So, in other words, i don't listen to music to create mixes. Rather, i create mixes because i listen to music. Because i listen to things that help me wind down, or drive away bad thoughts and stress that could be plaguing me.
And i listen to music because it's the best way i know to cope with truly anything that happens in your life, wether these things are bad, good, or anything in between.
Anyway, it's getting late, see you when i see you.
