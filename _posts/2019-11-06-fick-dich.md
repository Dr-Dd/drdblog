This time i kind of cheated. This is the first mix that i've ever done, over 3 years ago. Not only that, it's also probably the most experimental, well-mixed, aggressive and also personally involved one i've ever done. Let's call it a farewell to my adolescent life, since it's the last thing that i've done before moving out to study abroad. The disclaimer on the top of the page it's no mistake, there's alot of teen angst in the music that i've chosen, so let's just say that the tracks tend to "attack you" at times. But still, this is probably the most distilled form of myself that i've ever been able to capture, so maybe it's normal that it's like that, teen years are hard for everyone. I can't expect everyone to like everything i do, and that's normal.  
For reasons i do not have the time to talk about i never decided to publish it, or talk about it, or share it with anyone. That's because i've always done them for myself, not other people. But maybe, just maybe, i realized that some of this music might be useful to people other than me. So have a listen, hopefully you'll find something good for you too. See you when i see you.  
P.S. I don't know a word of German.
