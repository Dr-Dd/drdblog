# Uncultured Review #1: Kurt Vonnegut, Dresden and everything in between

So, you may ask, what does an Italian have to do with an intensely American writer. Not only that, but an American writer that usually isn't thrown around with the usual suspects such as Twain, Hemingway, and isn't even studied at school (at least, that was my case). All lies in a fortuitous combination of a musician, some wikipedia diving, and genuine curiosity.
As some of you may already know, i listen to lots of music. In particular, during adolescence, i used to vent all my teen-angst with lots of hip-hop. My favourite artists though, where the ones that did things really differently, that didn't conform fully to the customs of their "genre". One of this artists was El-P, a producer that liked to pepper in his tracks references to a lot of science fiction writers. In fact, listening to "T.O.J.", a piece from his debut album "Fantastic Damage", while reading the lyrics i came to know the existence of Philip K. Dick, whose book "Time out of Joint" was being cited in this track.
Really liking science fiction, i started to skim through his wikipedia article, his books, and related pages. That's when i discovered Vonnegut. While reading the plot for some of his books, i was so mesmerized by the amount of cult surrounding many of his operas.
So i decided to bite the bullet, and buy "Cat's Cradle" (IT: Ghiaccio Nove). Around one week later i was fully invested in the church of Bokonon.

# Cat's Cradle, or how to accept life's injustices

Vonnegut's life wasn't easy. He lost his father when he was just a kid, even though his family was relatively wealthy, and he not only lived through WW2, but took part in it, and was even POW in Dresden, where he survived its bombing. But he indeed lived through it, and got back (physically) unscathed from the experience, but with a lot of questions in his mind.
Cat's cradle isn't a hard book to read, chapters sometimes last as little as one paragraph, the themes are deep and serious but expressed in a very pleasant and even funny way, and most of all it hasn't got a hint of pretentiousness.
Vonnegut was alive when Hiroshima and Nagasaki got erased from existence, and the thing that he asked himself (and probably the rest of the world too) was, how could a scientist, someone who is infatuated with nature, or at least its analysis, create something that he knows is the most destructive thing ever created, willingly?
Things could be explained from many perspectives, with the most common being the political one. The war was ending, and Americans needed to beat the Germans at doing the same thing that they were doing. This answer is mostly satisfactory, but Vonnegut doesn't even dabble in politics in his book, or better, in most of his books.
What Vonnegut loves to talk about is people, specifically the way they cope with their problems, or even how they identify them. This kind of analysis was very valuable to an adolescent stricken with the much common existential crises that youths tend to have at that age (or maybe even later).
In fact, what he focuses about in his book is not reality, but a fictional scientist, Felix Hoenniker, sole inventor of the dirty bomb, and a writer, John, who wants to write what the important people of America were doing, and thinking, the day the bombs were dropped.
In some way or another, John ends up in San Lorenzo, a poor island with a very peculiar religion, Bokononism, after his creator, Bokonon, that essentialy is the ultimate way to cope with life's injustices.
I won't spoil you anything more about this book, but i suggest you to blind read it if any of this has sparked any curiosity in you.

# Bokononism, or the best religion that doesn't exist

In theory, San Lorenzo is a strictly Christian country, with all other religions banned. In particular, Bokononism is banned, and even punished by hanging on a hook, with the exception that everyone on the island, even the dictator, is in fact Bokononist. Bokononism is based on *foma*, which are *harmless untruths*. In other words, the religion is based entirely on lies, but whoever decides to live life following these lies, will never have a problem accepting the world and what happens to him as it is. In fact, the first thing that is written in the *Book of Bokonon* (a sort of bible for bokononists) is

> *"Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma! All of the true things that I am about to tell you are shameless lies."*

Lies that me, as a teenager, liked to think about, laugh at, or even try to follow. In other words things that make your mind workout, but in a good way. So, i strongly suggest you to read at least part of it. Busy, busy, busy.

# Slaughterhouse 5, or the Children's Crusade

The other book that i've read immediately after *Cat's Cradle* its his most famous one, *Slaughterhouse 5*, a sort of half autobiography, half science fiction book about an everyday joe, Billy Pilgrim, who survived Dresden together with Vonnegut, but happened to be abducted by aliens many years after his return from war. Billy is also "unstuck in time", a severe condition, that causes ones body to travel without a sense of continuity between different time periods of his own life, sometimes in the past, sometimes in the future, sometimes even in the present. As you can see, things get pretty mixed up, and voluntarily so.
The aliens that abduct Billy are Tralfamadorians, an alien race that is able to see in four-dimensions. In layman terms, they "can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains". In fact, they become so used to realizing that ones life has death at one point of it, that their response from hearing of ones death is "So it goes".
Tralfamadorians are, just like Bokononists, another example of Vonnegut's view of events in life. If one fixates itself in trying to understand what's good and what's bad in someones life, he is doomed to fail again and again at making sense of what's happening to him. Not because such a way of thinking is bad, but because we, as humans, are completely unable to give a sense to everything that happens to us. We may be able to predict, or even control ourselves and our emotions, or at least we may think we are. But we can't be so presomptuous as to think that what we are doing is right in every way or shape possible. The only certainty that we can have is that we, as individuals, are able to influence someones life, and the least we can do, is *try* to make sure that we don't hurt anyone as much as possible.
I managed to learn all of this by reading everything that Vonnegut's has written, and falling in love with his character, in one way or another. I do realize that what i've written is very difficult to wrap your head around immediately by just reading it once, but i can assure you, it's worth to try and see if you like anything that such an author has written.

# Conclusions

Vonnegut is a big part of my life. All media that we ingest changes us in some minute, miniscule way. Some kind of media is superficial, simple, and is there just to entertain us. Some media is there to communicate something important to us, and sometimes it scares ones person at consuming it, because you are expected to *listen* to what's happening. Vonnegut manages to fall perfectly between these two aspects.
His books came into my life in a time of serious needing of psychological guidance, that i was unable to find elsewhere. And they have had an immense impact on it, and still do to this day.
So, in other words, have a read, maybe he will better your life too.
