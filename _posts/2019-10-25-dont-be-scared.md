So, with this mix, i tried to create a pseudo "halloween" themed playlist. In the end, i wouldn't say that i failed, but certainly i realize that the songs are more about having to do with dark themes than, effectively, hallow's eve.
Here in Italy people aren't really that crazy about halloween. Yeah sure, we do have parties, it's still an excuse to have fun. But since i was little i've always wondered how it must be to walk around the neighbourhood dressed as some kind of "monster" to ask random strangers for some candy.
This is probably the last mix i'll do in a long time. I tried to clock in as much time as i could on this blog, and while i am clearly able to produce content twice a week, i only can because i don't have lots of obligations right now. This will quickly change in about a week.
Still, writing small articles about things that interest me is much easier than composing sequences of five - seven or even more tracks. Although at the end of the day accomplishing this last endeavour is extremely more satisfying.
But in this years i've also realized that, when you have a passion, one which needs some kind of creativity, forcing it out of yourself isn't the best course of actions.
When you get an idea, you'll get the idea before you start piecing your project together, that's how creativity works. And stemming from that inspiration is a feedback loop, that ends in a finished product, may it be good or bad.
So i'll try to not stress myself too much. Have a nice start of November, and don't get too spooked.
See you when i see you.
